# epikinetics
[![Project Status: WIP â€“ Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip) [![R-CMD-check](https://github.com/seroanalytics/epikinetics/actions/workflows/check-standard.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/seroanalytics/epikinetics/actions/workflows/check-standard.yaml) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/seroanalytics/epikinetics/graph/badge.svg?token=5MZYYDUZYH)](https://codecov.io/gh/seroanalytics/epikinetics)

`epikinetics` is an R package for Bayesian hierarchical modelling of antibody kinetics.

The underlying model is taken from [Russell TW et al., Real-time estimation of immunological responses against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants in the UK: a mathematical modelling study.](#References)
See the [case study vignette](https://seroanalytics.org/epikinetics/articles/biokinetics.html) for a replication of some key figures from the paper using `epikinetics`.

Three publicly available datasets from the above paper are also installed with the package and 
can be used as test input data:

```{r}
delta <- data.table::fread(system.file("delta_full.rds", package = "epikinetics"))
ba2 <- data.table::fread(system.file("ba2_full.rds", package = "epikinetics"))
xbb <- data.table::fread(system.file("xbb_full.rds", package = "epikinetics"))
```

If running the model with your own data, see the [data vignette](https://seroanalytics.org/epikinetics/articles/data.html) for 
an explanation of the input format. 

# Installing

To interface with [cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan), this package uses `cmdstanr`, which isn't available on cran, so you will first have to install it as follows:

```
install.packages('cmdstanr', repos = c('https://stan-dev.r-universe.dev', getOption('repos')))
```

You can then install `epikinetics` from GitHub:

```
remotes::install_github("seroanalytics/epikinetics")
```

## Troubleshooting installation

If you don't already have [cmdstan](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/cmdstan) installed, the `epikinetics` installer will attempt 
to install it, which can take a few minutes. If you see errors as part of installation, it is 
probably a good idea to try and install `cmdstan` first, for easier debugging. You can 
do this using the `cmdstanr` package as follows:

```{r}
cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()
```

Verify the installation is working with

```{r}
cmdstanr::cmdstan_version()
```

# Running in Docker

Alternatively, you can run `epikinetics` via a Docker image, mounting a working directory which contains your input data files:

```
docker pull seroanalytics/epikinetics:main
docker run -v /path/to/local/workdir:/workdir -it seroanalytics/epikinetics:main
```

# Developing

This package relies on the [instantiate](https://wlandau.github.io/instantiate/) package 
to ship pre-compiled stan models. See the `src/install.libs.R` file for the logic for compiling 
and installing the stan models during package installation. 

When running via `devtools` (e.g. `test` or `load_all`) the `install.libs.R` logic is not run, 
so for this we use an `onLoad` hook which checks whether the package is being loaded via `devtools`
and if so, copies compiled models into a local `bin` directory where the `system.file` shim
can access them.

Note that if you are running `devtools::load_all` or `devtool::test` and you don't yet 
have `cmdstan` installed, this will trigger an installation of `cmdstan` which can take 
a few minutes.

## Testing

To run all tests locally:

```{r}
devtools::test()
```

To run tests in a single file:

```{r}
devtools::test(filter="filename")
```

Some tests are skipped on CI to avoid exorbitantly long build times, but this means 
it is important to run all tests locally at least once before merging a pull request.

For snapshot testing of stan model outputs, we need the outputs to be exactly 
reproducible. As well as setting a seed, this requires the machine environment 
to be exactly the same, so on CI we run these inside a Docker container, via a bash script:

```{shell}
./tests/snapshots/test-snapshots
```

This involves recompiling the model, so takes a while to run.

Note that 

## Docker
To build a Docker image, run `docker/build`. 
To push a new image to Dockerhub, `docker/push`. An image is built and pushed 
during CI on merge to main.
